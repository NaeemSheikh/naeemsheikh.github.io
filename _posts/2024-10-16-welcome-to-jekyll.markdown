Hi there!

How anyone other than me might see this, I don't know. However, if you do, this place should have a couple posts regarding stuff that interests me. 

Learning is one thing, but going beyond just reading or attending lectures requires effort to gain more than just surface level knowledge. This place will be one of my outlets to get into my understanding of the theoretical concepts regarding different things I am interested about. 

Along with projects that I hopefully start doing and posting to build up my portfolio, I really want these efforts to help me feel more confident in my practical and theoretical understanding beyond just what I am learning.

The main topics I think I will talk about initially is:
* Computer Vision
* Artificial Intelligence
* Data Structures and Algorithms
* Mathematics
* Django Web Framework

Other things I would like to get into later would be:
* Embedded Systems
* Electronics
* Biomedical Engineering
* Django REST Framework

Hoping I can figure out a workflow to do what I envision with this. 
Wish me luck!

And have a nice day! Bye!
