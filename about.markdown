Hey, how are you doing?

My name is Naeem, I studied and worked professionally as a Biomedical Engineer where I eventually realized that I liked programming and computer science more. Currently pursuing a Master's degree in computer science now. Also trying to build up the necessary skills and toolset and attempt to make the switch to a job in this field.

This place is a blog to organize my thoughts regarding what I learn, projects I do and things I find interesting. The main focus will be on Computer Vision (CV), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Structures and algorithms (DSA), Django web framework, and other things.
